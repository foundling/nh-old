DESCRIPTION:
 Function objects created with the Function constructor are parsed when the function is created. This is less efficient than declaring a function with a function expression or function statement and calling it within your code, because such functions are parsed with the rest of the code. 

PROPERTIES:

 Function.arguments  
 An array corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. This is deprecated as property of Function, use the arguments object available within the function instead.

 Function.arity  
 Used to specifiy the number of arguments expected by the function, but has been removed. Use the length property instead.

 Function.caller  
 Specifies the function that invoked the currently executing function.

 Function.length
 Specifies the number of arguments expected by the function.

 Function.name  
 The name of the function.

 Function.displayName  
 The display name of the function.

 Function.prototype.constructor
 Specifies the function that creates an object's prototype. See Object.prototype.constructor for more details.
 

METHODS:
 Function.prototype.apply()
 Applies the method of another object in the context of a different object (the calling object); arguments can be passed as an Array object.

 Function.prototype.bind()
 Creates a new function which, when called, itself calls this function in the context of the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function was called.

 Function.prototype.call()
 Calls (executes) a method of another object in the context of a different object (the calling object); arguments can be passed as they are.

 Function.prototype.isGenerator()  
 Returns true if the function is a generator; otherwise returns false.

 Function.prototype.toSource()  
 Returns a string representing the source code of the function. Overrides the Object.prototype.toSource method.

 Function.prototype.toString()
 Returns a string representing the source code of the function. Overrides the Object.prototype.toString method.
 

DESCRIPTION:
 The Object constructor creates an object wrapper for the given value. If the value is null or undefined, it will create and return an empty object, otherwise, it will return an object of a Type that corresponds to the given value. If the value is an object already, it will return the value. 

PROPERTIES:
 Object.prototype.constructor
 Specifies the function that creates an object's prototype.
 Object.prototype.__proto__  
 Points to the object which was used as prototype when the object was instantiated.
 Object.prototype.__noSuchMethod__  
 Allows a function to be defined that will be executed when an undefined object member is called as a method.
 Object.prototype.__count__  
 Used to return the number of enumerable properties directly on a user-defined object, but has been removed.
 Object.prototype.__parent__  
 Used to point to an object's context, but has been removed.
 

METHODS:
 Object.prototype.__defineGetter__()    
 Associates a function with a property that, when accessed, executes that function and returns its return value.
 Object.prototype.__defineSetter__()    
 Associates a function with a property that, when set, executes that function which modifies the property.
 Object.prototype.__lookupGetter__()    
 Returns the function associated with the specified property by the __defineGetter__ method.
 Object.prototype.__lookupSetter__()    
 Returns the function associated with the specified property by the __defineSetter__ method.
 Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
 Returns a boolean indicating whether an object contains the specified property as a direct property of that object and not inherited through the prototype chain.
 Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf()
 Returns a boolean indication whether the specified object is in the prototype chain of the object this method is called upon.
 Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable()
 Returns a boolean indicating if the internal ECMAScript DontEnum attribute is set.
 Object.prototype.toSource()  
 Returns string containing the source of an object literal representing the object that this method is called upon; you can use this value to create a new object.
 Object.prototype.toLocaleString()
 Calls toString().
 Object.prototype.toString()
 Returns a string representation of the object.
 Object.prototype.unwatch()  
 Removes a watchpoint from a property of the object.
 Object.prototype.valueOf()
 Returns the primitive value of the specified object.
 Object.prototype.watch()  
 Adds a watchpoint to a property of the object.
 Object.prototype.eval()  
 Used to evaluate a string of JavaScript code in the context of the specified object, but has been removed.
 

DESCRIPTION:
 The primary uses for the Number object are: 

PROPERTIES:
 
 Number.EPSILON  
 The smallest interval between two representable numbers.
 Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER  
 The maximum safe integer in JavaScript (253 - 1).
 Number.MAX_VALUE
 The largest positive representable number.
 Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER  
 The minimum safe integer in JavaScript (-(253 - 1)).
 Number.MIN_VALUE
 The smallest positive representable number - that is, the positive number closest to zero (without actually being zero).
 Number.NaN
 Special "not a number" value.
 Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
 Special value representing negative infinity; returned on overflow.
 Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY
 Special value representing infinity; returned on overflow.
 Number.prototype
 Allows the addition of properties to a Number object.
 

METHODS:
 
 Number.isNaN()  
 Determine whether the passed value is NaN.
 Number.isFinite()  
 Determine whether the passed value is a finite number.
 Number.isInteger()  
 Determine whether the passed value is an integer.
 Number.isSafeInteger()  
 Determine whether theÂ passed value is a safe integer (number between -(253 - 1) and 253 - 1).
 Number.toInteger()  
 Used to evaluate the passed value and convert it to an integer (or Infinity), but has been removed.
 Number.parseFloat()  
 The value is the same as parseFloat() of the global object.
 Number.parseInt()  
 The value is the same as parseInt() of the global object.
 

DESCRIPTION:
 Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method. 

PROPERTIES:
 
 String.prototype
 Allows the addition of properties to a String object.
 

METHODS:
 
 String.fromCharCode()
 Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of Unicode values.
 String.fromCodePoint()  
 Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of code points.
 String.raw()  
 Returns a string created from a raw template string.
 

DESCRIPTION:
 The value passed as the first parameter is converted to a boolean value, if necessary. If value is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false. All other values, including any object or the string "false", create an object with an initial value of true. 

PROPERTIES:
 
 Boolean.length
 Length property whose value is 1.
 Boolean.prototype
 Represents the prototype for the Boolean constructor.
 

METHODS:
 For methods available on Boolean instances, see Methods of Boolean instances. 

DESCRIPTION:
 Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's size length grow or shrink at any time, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.
