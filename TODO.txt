[todo]


1. MOST IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT: Need to get documentation for each method and object, in 'get_raw_docs' function, so this will be a recursive function.
example: Array.from() has the same visual structure as Array, so verify that you can scrape it in the same way, then implement the recursion.

2. separate out the MDN scraping from the building api docs functionality

3. add native boolean field to distinguish between node and native objs. 
4. workout the db recursive traversal algorithm, 3. fix it to take into account the new { version: docs } structure
