[todo]
1. add native boolean field to distinguish between node and native objs. 
2. workout the db recursive traversal algorithm, 3. fix it to take into account the new { version: docs } structure

MOST IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT:

3. Need to get documentation for each method and object, in 'get_raw_docs' function, so this will be a recursive function.
example: Array.from() has the same visual structure as Array, so verify that you can scrape it in the same way, then implement the recursion.
