api server:
  - checks date against last update
  - if date is a week past the last update, rerun doc download/parse and send new version
  - concatenate each doc set and generate a hash to indicate uniqueness. send this hash before
    sending the docs. 

local client:
  - when user starts node-help, hit api at [ api/nodehelp/version ] for updated docs.
  - api gives a docset unique  hash. if matches client's, exit without updating, docs up
    to date.
  - if it doesn't match, hit server again at [ api/nodehelp ]
  - again for data
